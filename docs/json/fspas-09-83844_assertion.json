    "We explore a convolutional neural network's (CNN) ability to predict the embedded magnetic flux rope's orientation once it has been identified from in situ solar wind observations.",
    "This work is an attempt to understand if a neural network can predict a flux rope's orientation having only seen a portion of the event, providing advanced warning of impending geomagnetic disturbance.",
    "In these idealized, synthetic, circular-cylindrical flux ropes even the poorest performing network is able to predict orientation angles with a median error under 8Â° after only observing 10% of a simulated spacecraft crossing.",
    "Our experiments have demonstrated that convolutional neural networks are capable of providing extremely reliable characterizations of flux ropes from synthetic data.",
    "Neural networks trained on synthetic events do not transfer perfectly to Wind spacecraft data due to incorrect physical models and internal physical processes.",
    "The neural network trained only on full duration synthetic flux ropes can provide reliable predictions in a number of Wind events and suggests better fittings for some."

    "Various physics-based flux rope models exist that can be used to reconstruct the internal ICME magnetic configuration and provide information on orientation, geometry, and other magnetic parameters.",
    "Nguyen et al. (2018) have explored machine learning techniques for automated identification of ICMEs and dos Santos et al. (2020) used a deep neural network to create a binary classifier for flux ropes in the solar wind.",
    "The CNN is the basis of the neural network architectures explored in this work. The training phase consists of showing the network the input-output pairs of simulated flux rope magnetic field vectors and the corresponding key parameters used to create this simulated data trace.",
