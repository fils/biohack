{
  "hypothesis": [
    "We are interested in how science collaboration and networking are taking place and how the procedures of the AGU Fall meeting could be enhanced to facilitate better scientific communication and collaboration."
  ],
  "supportingArguments": [
    "We apply network analysis and scientometrics to seventeen years of AGU Fall Meetings, modeling them as graphs where presentation co-authors are connected nodes.",
    "The study includes the analysis of seventeen years of data and covers various sub-disciplines within Earth and space science at AGU."
  ],
  "researchOpportunities": [],
  "methodology": [
    "Data were retrieved by querying the AGU Abstract Browserâ€™s Linked Open Data interface.",
    "The authors model each AGU section as an undirected network based on co-authorship.",
    "The analysis involves computing network density and connected components across the various sections of AGU Fall Meetings."
  ],
  "results": [
    "Network density decreases for all sections, suggesting that nodes are being added faster than edges.",
    "A large number of connected components was found, indicating fragmentation within the networks of co-authors in each section.",
    "An analysis of multi-disciplinary authorship is conducted, showing significant cross-disciplinary collaborations."
  ],
  "conclusions": [
    "The number and fragmentation of network components highlight the need for better connectivity between clusters, which can improve scientific collaboration and communication."
  ],
  "limitations": [
    "The difficulty in disambiguating authors due to variations in naming conventions and affiliations, which affects the accuracy of the network graphs.",
    "Inherent uncertainty exists in the results due to potential multiple nodes representing the same person."
  ],
  "futureDirections": [
    "Optimizing meeting space at AGU Fall Meetings using the network and keyword data to place related sections next to each other.",
    "Developing tools and apps that utilize meeting data to guide attendees in exploring network connections."
  ],
  "keyFindings": [
    "Network density is decreasing over time, indicating that new attendees are not forming connections at the same rate.",
    "There is a significant amount of fragmentation in the networks, with many single node components representing isolated researchers."
