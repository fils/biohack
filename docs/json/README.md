## About

The JSON in this document is in pairs.

* Assertions: which come from [assertions.baml](../../baml_src/assertions.baml)
* Ideas (bad name): which come from [hypothesis.baml](../../baml_src/hypothesis.baml)

In those two .baml files you can scroll down to the functiosn to see the 
prompt and the data class the data is aligned to.  

## Sources  

There are 7 sources here but only 6 sets of assertions and ideas in the JSON.  
So I must have a duplicate or missed one below.  However, it should work to 
align the JSON with the sources.
