    "Our work demonstrates how probabilistic neural networks can enhance the classification by including a measure of prediction uncertainty.",
    "Our work also provides a ranking of the parameters that lead to an improved classification scheme with ∼96% accuracy.",
    "The contribution of more plasma parameters - namely plasma β and Ptot - increase the accuracy from ∼88% (in the case of 3PNN) to ∼96% (in the case of 8PNN).",
    "We find that a two step approach of first distinguishing ICMEs (a combined group of MO and SH) and then classifying ICME into MO and SH is more practically effective.",
    "Our approach has the potential to be implemented on real-time solar wind data and support space weather now-casting and forecasting operations."

  "Supporting": [
    "We used neural networks trained with different solar wind magnetic and plasma characteristics to automatically classify the solar wind.",
    "We used one minute resolution solar wind magnetic field and plasma data observed in situ by the Magnetic Field Instrument (MFI) and the Solar Wind Experiment (SWE) onboard the Wind spacecraft.",
    "Data are then randomly split with the standard 80% for training the neural networks and the remaining 20% used for evaluating the trained networks.",
    "Placing a probability distribution over the NN output layer is method of capturing aleatoric uncertainty, which is uncertainty inherent in the observations.",
    "We normalize our data using minimum and maximum values from the entire dataset."
