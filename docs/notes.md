## Results

```json

  "hypothesis": [
    "This study hypothesizes that Angiopep-2-based chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) MRI can visualize and assess the clearance function of the glymphatic system in vivo, as indicated by statements like 'we describe an MRI method based on chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) of the Angiopep-2 probe to visualize the clearance function of the glymphatic system.'"
  ],
  "supportingArguments": [
    "Experimental data showed higher CEST signals in rats with impaired glymphatic function (e.g., deep cervical lymph node ligation and ageing groups) compared to controls, supporting the hypothesis; references to prior studies (e.g., Iliff et al. 2012, 2013) on glymphatic dysfunction provide additional reasoning."
  ],
  "researchOpportunities": [
    "Gaps include challenges in imaging the glymphatic system due to the blood-brain barrier, as noted in the introduction; the discussion suggests opportunities like exploring CEST sequence optimization and Angiopep-2 modifications for better results."
  ],
  "methodology": [
    "Rats were injected with Angiopep-2 via the tail vein and scanned using CEST-MRI at 7 T at various time points (0, 30, 60, 90, 120 min); models included bilateral deep cervical lymph node ligation and ageing rats, with fluorescence staining and behavioral tests (e.g., Morris water maze) also employed."
  ],
  "results": [
    "DCLN and ageing rats showed higher CEST signals than controls, with peak enhancement at 60 minutes; fluorescence staining confirmed more FITC-Angiopep-2 residue in impaired glymphatic models, and behavioral tests indicated spatial memory decline in DCLN rats."
  ],
  "conclusions": [
    "The study concludes that Angiopep-2 CEST MRI can visualize clearance in the glymphatic system, as stated: 'We conclude that this new MRI method can visualize clearance in the glymphatic system.'"
  ],
  "limitations": [
    "Not explicitly mentioned, but inferred: GBCAs have limited blood-brain barrier penetration, higher doses were used which may not translate to clinical settings, and scanning was limited to a single layer due to time constraints, potentially affecting applicability."
  ],
  "futureDirections": [
    "Future work should investigate modifying Angiopep-2 concentration, optimizing CEST sequences for reduced scanning time and 3D whole-brain imaging, and addressing clinical limitations like injection volume, as suggested in the discussion."
  ],
  "keyFindings": [
    "Angiopep-2 CEST MRI demonstrated feasibility for assessing glymphatic clearance, with higher signals in impaired models (DCLN and ageing rats), confirming its potential for visualizing dysfunction."
